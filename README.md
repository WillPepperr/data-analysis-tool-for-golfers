## Modifying the Course Database

The **17,000+ course database** is in the **"Course Database"** sheet.

### Adding a New Course

2. Navigate to the **bottom of the course table**.
   - *Tip:* Press `Ctrl + Space` to quickly select the last row, then click the cell below it.
3. **Enter your course details** following the format of existing entries.
   - *For courses with fewer than 18 holes:*
     - Mark remaining holes as **0** (e.g., for a 9-hole course, back 9 should be `0`).

     - The **total** column should match the front 9.
